</div>

The Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrate the long-term survival characteristic of IPMN patients, with censoring marks (|) showing patients still alive at last follow-up. The nearly equal split between events and censored cases (48.5% vs 51.5%) provides balanced outcomes for survival modeling.

</div>

### Patient Characteristics

#### Body Mass Index (BMI)
- **Mean**: 27.5 (SD: 5.4)
- **Range**: Includes normal weight to obese patients
- **Clinical Relevance**: Higher BMI associated with increased IPMN risk

| Never Smokers | 98 | 57.3% |
| Ever Smokers | 73 | 42.7% |

#### Family History
| Cancer Type | Positive History | Percentage |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Pancreatic Cancer | 43 | 25.1% |
| Any Cancer | 114 | 66.7% |

The high rate of positive family history (especially pancreatic cancer at 25.1%) highlights the genetic component in IPMN development.

### Laboratory Values

#### Serum CA 19-9
- **Available**: 157/171 patients (91.8%)
- **Mean**: 216.1 U/mL
- **Median**: 15.8 U/mL
- **Clinical Significance**: Elevated CA 19-9 associated with malignancy risk

The skewed distribution (mean >> median) indicates most patients have normal values with some having markedly elevated levels.

| Invasive | 49 | 28.7% |

</div>

The progression from low-grade to invasive disease demonstrates the importance of risk stratification in IPMN management.

### PDAC Origin (when present)

For patients with concurrent PDAC (n=48 with data):
- **IPMN-derived**: 25 patients (52.1%)
- **Separate lesions**: 15 patients (31.3%)

## üñºÔ∏è Multimodal Data Components

### 1. CT Imaging Data

<div align="center">

| **Feature** | **Value** |
|-------------|-----------|
| Availability | 100% |
| Primary Protocol | Arterial + Non-contrast + Venous |
| Protocol Coverage | 87.1% |
| Embedding Dimensions | 1024 |

</div>

#### Imaging Protocols
- **Triple Phase**: 149 patients (87.1%)
  - Non-contrast phase
  - Arterial phase
  - Venous phase
- **Other protocols**: 22 patients (12.9%)

The standardized triple-phase protocol enables optimal visualization of pancreatic lesions and vascular involvement.

### 2. Clinical Report Embeddings

#### Radiology Reports
- **Availability**: 78.9% (135/171 patients)
- **Embedding Dimensions**: 1024
- **Content**: Detailed descriptions of cyst characteristics

#### Pathology Reports
- **Availability**: 98.2% (168/171 patients)
- **Embedding Dimensions**: 1024
- **Content**: Histological findings, grade, invasion status

The high pathology report coverage reflects that most patients underwent surgical resection or biopsy.

### 3. Clinical Features

The dataset includes 35 clinical variables covering:
- Demographics and risk factors
- Laboratory values (CA 19-9, CEA)
- Imaging characteristics
- Surgical findings
- Pathological outcomes

## üìà EAGLE Model Performance on IPMN

Based on the experimental results:

<div align="center">

</div>

### Risk Stratification Performance

The EAGLE model successfully stratifies patients into three risk groups with distinct survival profiles, enabling personalized surveillance strategies.

### Modality Contributions

Average modality importance varies by patient risk:
- **High-risk patients**: Pathology reports dominate (>40%)
- **Low-risk patients**: Imaging features more important (>35%)
- **Clinical features**: Consistent contribution (~30%)

## üè• Clinical Management Implications

### Surveillance Guidelines

Based on risk stratification:

#### Low Risk Group
- **Characteristics**: Small cysts, no worrisome features
- **Management**: Annual surveillance
- **Outcome**: <5% progression to cancer

#### Medium Risk Group
- **Characteristics**: Intermediate features
- **Management**: 6-month surveillance
- **Outcome**: 10-20% progression risk

#### High Risk Group
- **Characteristics**: Worrisome features or high-grade dysplasia
- **Management**: Consider resection
- **Outcome**: >30% malignancy risk

### Decision Points

Key factors influencing management:
1. **Cyst size** and growth rate
2. **Main duct involvement**
3. **Mural nodules**
4. **CA 19-9 levels**
5. **Patient fitness for surgery**
